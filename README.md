## RFM ANALYSIS
* RFM is a data modeling method used to analyze customer value. 
* It stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary which are the three metrics that describes the customers. 
* It is a indexing technique that uses past purchase behaviour to segment customers.
#### `Recency`
* Last Order Date
#### `Frequency`
* Count of Total Orders
#### `Monetary`
* Total Money Spend
