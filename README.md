In this project, I have explored a sales dataset and performed various analyses and drew insights from customer's past purchase behavior by RFM technique customer segmentation using SQL and built a sales dashboard in Tableau.

## RFM ANALYSIS

* It stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary which are the three metrics that describes the customers. 
* It is a indexing technique that uses past purchase behaviour to segment customers.
#### `Recency`
* Last Order Date
#### `Frequency`
* Count of Total Orders
